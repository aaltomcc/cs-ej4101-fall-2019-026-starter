# Welcome to this course!
This is a very first simple Github page for the sake of:
- Practice
- Try out
- Have fun!

Keep on reading! The meat is in the next (and the one after the next) chapters.

And this paragraph is definitely not here just for the sake of creating multiple paragraphs in this section!

# Expectation vs Reality
## Expectation of my learning
After the course, I expect to be able to:
- Ops like a pro
- AWS, Azure, Baba cloud... in my hand
- Automate my life

And surprise is good too!

## What I learned so far?
Too early to tell. The most challenging part? Waiting for the course to start! And trying to fulfill the word counts requirement.

And since I am not gonna write a touching paragraph about my study, I will continue with the intersting story of **my** life to fill up the 250-500 words count requirement.

# Story of my life
## I learned my lession
Over time, I develop an empathy for the Winchesters, in particular Dean. When I learns that Michael actually intends for Lucifer to be released so I can kill him, I tries to warn Dean, but is punished. Ultimately, I break allegiance with Heaven to side with humanity. You may wonder why?
- Angels are a bunch of liars
- Humanity is cool!
- I can eat all the pizzas I want

With Lucifer free, and I cut off from Heaven's power, I decides to try and find the long absent God. When I learns God is not interested in intervening to stop the Apocalypse, I is devastated. I work to support the efforts of Sam, Dean and Bobby in stopping the battle between Michael and Lucifer.
