# About
This site has nothing more than this landing page and a secret diary!
Something about me: My name is Castiel. I am an angel. I manifests on Earth inside his vessel, Jimmy Novak. I am the only angel that is shown to have been resurrected after having been killed, and I has been resurrected more than once.
Many angels laid siege to Hell to rescue Dean, but it was Castiel who ultimately pulled Dean out. According to Castiel, I did so "Because God commanded it." His hand print was burned into Dean's left shoulder. Castiel is amongst a group of angels who manifest on Earth to stop the breaking of the the 66 Seals which will release Lucifer and start the Apocalypse.
